"RADON MAPPING"

Dataset downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/chernobyl-chemical-radiation-csv-country-data

We wanted to showcase the effects of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster in Ukraine and its effect across the rest of Europe. By aggregating iodine levels measured daily for the month following the accident (4/30/1986-5/30/1986) from 10 cities across western Europe, our aim was to create a visual representation of the overall trends of the aftermath, as well as to show how quickly and heavily radiation was able to spread through the continent. We tried to cater our design for young adults, with its intended context being an interactive exhibit inside a science museum.
